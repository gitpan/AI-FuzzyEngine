=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module is yet another implementation of a fuzzy inference system.
The aim was to  be able to code rules (no string parsing),
but avoid operator overloading,
and make it possible to split calculation into multiple steps.
All intermediate results (memberships of sets of variables)
should be available.

Credits to Ala Qumsieh and his L<AI::FuzzyInference>,
that showed me that fuzzy is no magic.
I learned a lot by analyzing his code,
and he provides good information and links to learn more about Fuzzy Logics.

=head2 Fuzzy stuff

The L<AI::FuzzyEngine> object defines and provides
the elementary operations for fuzzy sets.
All set memberships are values from 0 to 1.
Up to now there is no choice with regard how to operate on sets:

=over 2

=item C<< $fe->or( ... ) >> (Disjunction)

I<Maximum> of membership degrees

=item C<< $fe->and( ... ) >> (Conjunction)

I<Minimum> of membership degrees

=item C<< $fe->not( $var->$set ) >> (Negation)

I<1-degree> of membership

=item Aggregation of rules (Disjunction)

I<Maximum>

=back

Defuzzification is based on

=over 2

=item Implication

I<Clip> membership function of a set according to membership degree,
before the implicated memberships of all sets of a variable are taken for defuzzification:

=item Defuzzification

I<Centroid> of aggregated (and clipped) membership functions

=back

=head2 Public functions

Creation of an C<AI::FuzzyEngine> object by

    my $fe = AI::FuzzyEngine->new();

This function has no parameters, but provides the fuzzy methods
C<or>, C<and> and C<not>, as listed above.
I plan to introduce alternative fuzzy operations,
they will be configured as arguments to C<new>. 

Once created, the engine can create fuzzy variables by C<new_variable>:

    my $var = $fe->new_variable( $from => $to,
                        $name_of_set1 => [$x11, $y11, $x12, $y12, ... ],
                        $name_of_set2 => [$x21, $y21, $x22, $y22, ... ],
                        ...
                   );

Result is an L<AI::FuzzyEngine::Variable>.
The name_of_set strings are taken to assign corresponding methods
for the respective fuzzy variables.
They must be valid function identifiers.

Fuzzy variables provide a method to fuzzify input values:

    $var->fuzzify( $val );

according to the defined sets and their membership functions.

The memberships of the sets of $var are accessible
by the respective functions:

    my $membership_degree = $var->$name_of_set();

Memberships can be assigned directly (within rules for example):

    $var->$name_of_set( $membership_degree );

If multiple membership_degrees are given, they are "anded":

    $var->$name_of_set( $degree1, $degree2, ... ); # "and"

By this, simple rules can be coded directly:

    my $var_3->zzz( $var_1->xxx, $var_2->yyy, ... ); # "and"

this implements the fuzzy implication

    if $var_1->xxx and $var_2->yyy and ... then $var_3->zzz

The membership degrees of a variable's sets can be reset to undef:

    $var->reset(); # resets a variable
    $fe->reset();  # resets all variables

The fuzzy engine C<$fe> has all variables registered
that have been created by its C<new_variable> method.

A variable can be defuzzified:

    my $out_value = $var->defuzzify();

Sometimes internal variables are used that need neither fuzzification
nor defuzzification.
They can be created by a simplified call to C<new_variable>:

    my $var_int = $fe->new_variable( $name_of_set1 => [],
                                     $name_of_set2 => [],
                                     ...
                       );

Hence, they can not use the methods C<fuzzify> or C<defuzzify>.

Fuzzy operations are simple operations on floating values between 0 and 1:

    my $conjunction = $fe->and( $var1->xxx, $var2->yyy, ... );
    my $disjunction = $fe->or(  $var1->xxx, $var2->yyy, ... );
    my $negated     = $fe->not( $var1->zzz );

There is no magic.

A sequence of rules for the same set can be implemented as follows: 

    $var_3->zzz( $var_1->xxx, $var_2->yyy, ... );
    $var_3->zzz( $var_4->aaa, $var_5->bbb, ... );

The subsequent application of C<< $var_3->zzz(...) >>
corresponds to "or" operations (aggregation of rules).

Only a reset can reset C<$var_3>.
