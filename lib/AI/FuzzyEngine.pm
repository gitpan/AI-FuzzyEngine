=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module is yet another implementation of a fuzzy inference system.
The aim was to  be able to code rules (no string parsing),
but avoid operator overloading,
and make it possible to split calculation into multiple steps.
All intermediate results (memberships of sets of variables)
should be available.

Beginning with v0.2.0 it is PDL aware,
meaning that it can handle piddles (PDL objects)
when running the fuzzy operations.
More information on PDL can be found at L<http://pdl.perl.org/>. 

Credits to Ala Qumsieh and his L<AI::FuzzyInference>,
that showed me that fuzzy is no magic.
I learned a lot by analyzing his code,
and he provides good information and links to learn more about Fuzzy Logics.

=head2 Fuzzy stuff

The L<AI::FuzzyEngine> object defines and provides
the elementary operations for fuzzy sets.
All membership degrees of sets are values from 0 to 1.
Up to now there is no choice with regard to how to operate on sets:

=over 2

=item C<< $fe->or( ... ) >> (Disjunction)

is I<Maximum> of membership degrees

=item C<< $fe->and( ... ) >> (Conjunction)

is I<Minimum> of membership degrees

=item C<< $fe->not( $var->$set ) >> (Negation)

is I<1-degree> of membership degree

=item Aggregation of rules (Disjunction)

is I<Maximum>

=back

Defuzzification is based on

=over 2

=item Implication

I<Clip> membership function of a set according to membership degree,
before the implicated memberships of all sets of a variable are taken for defuzzification:

=item Defuzzification

I<Centroid> of aggregated (and clipped) membership functions

=back

=head2 Public functions

Creation of an C<AI::FuzzyEngine> object by

    my $fe = AI::FuzzyEngine->new();

This function has no parameters. It provides the fuzzy methods
C<or>, C<and> and C<not>, as listed above.
If needed, I will introduce alternative fuzzy operations,
they will be configured as arguments to C<new>. 

Once built, the engine can create fuzzy variables by C<new_variable>:

    my $var = $fe->new_variable( $from => $to,
                        $name_of_set1 => [$x11, $y11, $x12, $y12, ... ],
                        $name_of_set2 => [$x21, $y21, $x22, $y22, ... ],
                        ...
                   );

Result is an L<AI::FuzzyEngine::Variable>.
The name_of_set strings are taken to assign corresponding methods
for the respective fuzzy variables.
They must be valid function identifiers. 
Same name_of_set can used for different variables without conflict.
Take care: 
There is no check for conflicts with predefined class methods. 

Fuzzy variables provide a method to fuzzify input values:

    $var->fuzzify( $val );

according to the defined sets and their membership functions.

The memberships of the sets of C<$var> are accessible
by the respective functions:

    my $membership_degree = $var->$name_of_set();

Memberships can be assigned directly (within rules for example):

    $var->$name_of_set( $membership_degree );

If multiple membership_degrees are given, they are "anded":

    $var->$name_of_set( $degree1, $degree2, ... ); # "and"

By this, simple rules can be coded directly:

    my $var_3->zzz( $var_1->xxx, $var_2->yyy, ... ); # "and"

this implements the fuzzy implication

    if $var_1->xxx and $var_2->yyy and ... then $var_3->zzz

The membership degrees of a variable's sets can be reset to undef:

    $var->reset(); # resets a variable
    $fe->reset();  # resets all variables

The fuzzy engine C<$fe> has all variables registered
that have been created by its C<new_variable> method.

A variable can be defuzzified:

    my $out_value = $var->defuzzify();

Sometimes internal variables are used that need neither fuzzification
nor defuzzification.
They can be created by a simplified call to C<new_variable>:

    my $var_int = $fe->new_variable( $name_of_set1 => [],
                                     $name_of_set2 => [],
                                     ...
                       );

Hence, they can not use the methods C<fuzzify> or C<defuzzify>.

Fuzzy operations are simple operations on floating values between 0 and 1:

    my $conjunction = $fe->and( $var1->xxx, $var2->yyy, ... );
    my $disjunction = $fe->or(  $var1->xxx, $var2->yyy, ... );
    my $negated     = $fe->not( $var1->zzz );

There is no magic.

A sequence of rules for the same set can be implemented as follows: 

    $var_3->zzz( $var_1->xxx, $var_2->yyy, ... );
    $var_3->zzz( $var_4->aaa, $var_5->bbb, ... );

The subsequent application of C<< $var_3->zzz(...) >>
corresponds to "or" operations (aggregation of rules).

Only a reset can reset C<$var_3>. 

=head2 PDL awareness

Membership degrees of sets might be either scalars or piddles now.

    $var_a->memb_fun_a(        5  ); # degree of memb_fun_a is a scalar
    $var_a->memb_fun_b( pdl(7, 8) ); # degree of memb_fun_b is a piddle

Empty piddles are not allowed, behaviour with bad values is not tested.

Fuzzification (hence calculating degrees) accepts piddles:

    $var_b->fuzzify( pdl([1, 2], [3, 4]) );

Defuzzification returns a piddle if any of the membership
degrees of the function's sets is a piddle:

    my $val = $var_a->defuzzify(); # $var_a returns a 1dim piddle with two elements

So do the fuzzy operations as provided by the fuzzy engine C<$fe> itself.

Any operation on more then one piddle expands those to common
dimensions, if possible, or throws a PDL error otherwise. 

The way expansion is done is best explained by code
(see C<< AI::FuzzyEngine->_cat_array_of_piddles(@pdls) >>).
Assuming all piddles are in C<@pdls>,
calculation goes as follows:

    # Get the common dimensions
    my $zeros = PDL->pdl(0);
    # Note: $zeros += $_->zeros() for @pdls does not work here
    $zeros = $zeros + $_->zeros() for @pdls;

    # Expand all piddles
    @pdls = map {$_ + $zeros} @pdls;

Defuzzification uses some heavy non-threading code,
so there might be a performance penalty for big piddles.
