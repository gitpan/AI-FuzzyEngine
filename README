AI-FuzzyEngine

This module is yet another implementation of a fuzzy inference system.
The aim was to  be able to code rules (no string parsing), but avoid operator 
overloading, and make it possible to split calculation into multiple steps.
All intermediate results (memberships of sets of variables) should be 
available.

Credits to Ala Qumsieh and his L<AI::FuzzyInference>, that showed me that 
fuzzy is no magic. I learned a lot by analyzing his code, and he provides 
good information and links to learn more about Fuzzy Logics.
