AI-FuzzyEngine v0.2.0

This module is yet another implementation of a fuzzy inference system.
The aim was to  be able to code rules (no string parsing),
but avoid operator overloading,
and make it possible to split calculation into multiple steps.
All intermediate results (memberships of sets of variables)
should be available.

Beginning with v0.2.0 it is PDL aware,
meaning that it can handle piddles (PDL objects)
when running the fuzzy operations.
More information on PDL can be found at L<http://pdl.perl.org/>. 

Credits to Ala Qumsieh and his L<AI::FuzzyInference>,
that showed me that fuzzy is no magic.
I learned a lot by analyzing his code,
and he provides good information and links to learn more about Fuzzy Logics.
